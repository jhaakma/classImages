# Dynamic Class Images
## Version 1.0.0

by Melchior Dahrk and Merlord
Made for the Morrowind May Modathon 2023

### Description
This mod makes it so that the class images you see during character creation and when leveling up are specific to your class. No more recycling the vanilla image for custom classes!

This is accomplished by mixing nearly 100 different images based on criteria such as skills, attributes, and specialization. Every one of these images is dynamically generated -not hardcoded- by a complex set of logic. Choose alchemy as a major skill? Expect to see an apparatus or ingredients show up for your class. Major in long blades? There's a good chance that your class will get a longsword in the image. The potential combinations is enormous.

In addition to dynamically replacing images for custom classes, this mod also packages new HD renders of the vanilla classes which are faithful to the original arrangement.

### Requirements
This mod requires both [MWSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) and [UI Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071) to function as intended.

### Recommendations
We recommend using this mod with mods that add new classes to the game like [Ahead of the Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50346) or [Playable NPC Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43428). Merlord's new [Key Scroller](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52962) mod is also recommended for easier perusing of classes!
